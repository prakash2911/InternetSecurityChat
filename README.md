TriEncryption

The Internet of Things (IoT) is an area in which data is sent every second. The security of this data is a difficult undertaking; but security concerns can be addressed using cryptography and steganography techniques. When it comes to user authentication and data protection, these strategies are critical. The data transferred between the systems in the proposed work is encrypted, so that it cannot be leaked or stolen. Data is encrypted three times in order to prevent data from being altered or stolen and to protect user privacy.

Proposed Work

Nowadays, the Internet is a well-known, worldwide network that facilitates a variety of human interactions and human communication through social media, email, chat rooms, audio, and video transmission. It is an unstable open channel even though it is a worldwide network. The total dependence on the internet by humans has created a number of security problems.
Our efforts are mostly focused on securing networks with cryptograph. Messages' contents are hidden from both the sender and the intended receiver using secure communication techniques like encryption, which are referred to as "cryptography." Private key When all servers have access to a single server key that may be used to encrypt and decode data or information, cryptography is being utilized. The data or information in this project is triple-encrypted and triple-decrypted, which contributes to its increased security. A database is used to ensure that the server key is unique. Here, a database has all of the unique server keys.
To give an example. When data is transferred between two users, it is encrypted three times: once with the sender's private key, where the initial encryption was finished, and once more with the server key, which was created especially for the sender. Then, after being encrypted, the message or data was transmitted to a server, where a database retrieved the server key for the sender and unlocked it before retrieving the server key for the receiver and locking and sending it, where it entered the recipient's system. The receiver's private key must first decode the data using their unique server key in order to eliminate the double encryptions. The data and information will subsequently be accessible to the receiver
